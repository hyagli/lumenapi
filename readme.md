# Authentication REST-API built with Lumen PHP Framework

Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax.

I used it to build a simple authentication and authorization API for another Desktop application written in C# WPF.

## Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](http://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

The authentication logic can be found inside [UserController.php](app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php)

The authorization logic can be found inside [FirmaController.php](app/Http/Controllers/FirmaController.php)
